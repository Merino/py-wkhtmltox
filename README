Python bindings for the fabulous libwkhtmltox using Cython

Tested on Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard, Python 2.6.1 64-bit

Notes on compiling for Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard 64-bit:
---------------------------------------------------------
-you need Cython (tested with 0.13)
-you need libwkhtmltox.* somewhere in your LD path (/usr/local/lib)
-you need the wkhtmltox directory somewhere on your include path (/usr/local/inclue)
-until this bug is fixed (http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-5952) you need qt_menu.nib directory
from the QT source tree in the same directory as your libwkhtmltox.* libs
